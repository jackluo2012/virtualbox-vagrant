## virtualbox  
VirtualBox is a general-purpose full virtualizer for x86 hardware, targeted at server, desktop and embedded use.  
For a thorough introduction to virtualization and VirtualBox, please refer to the [online version](https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch01.html) of the VirtualBox User Manual's first chapter.  
**需要掌握的概念：**[虚拟机网络模式](Bridged-NAT-Host-Only.md)

## Vagrant  
Vagrant is a tool for building and managing virtual machine environments in a single workflow. With an easy-to-use workflow and focus on automation, Vagrant lowers development environment setup time, increases production parity, and makes the "works on my machine" excuse a relic of the past.

**需要掌握的概念：**vagrant要运行虚拟机，需要有一个box文件（就是直接在virtualbox中运行虚拟机需要有一个ISO文件一样），相当于虚拟机所依赖的镜像文件，可在[这里下查看](https://app.vagrantup.com/boxes/search)相关系统的box
